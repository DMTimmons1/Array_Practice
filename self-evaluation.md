## Array Self Evaluation

# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

- I feel pretty confident with arrays. It shows how data sets with strings, integers, floats, or booleans can be combined for orgaization and efficiency.

# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

- As of right now, I feel that I have a pretty good understadnig of arrays and how they communicate data sets. I'm sure as time goes on I'll have more questions on a specific method or process.

# What questions do you have about Arrays?

- I guess I just want to know what our limits are with arrays. Are there exceptions, or will every data set we use be comprised in arrays as elements?
